    <p>This guide, created by me, √çtalo Pereira, is designed to enhance my understanding of web development and assist other Ecoportal employees in their roles as implementation technicians. I plan to update this guide regularly as I gain more knowledge and confidence in various subjects.</p>
    
    <p>Remember, you can always return to this page by clicking on the logo in the left corner of the screen, above the sidebar.</p>
    
    <p>The structure of this website is as follows:</p>
    
    <p>On the left side, you'll find a sidebar with a filter. Use this filter to search for subjects you're interested in learning more about, such as forces. Each subject's "intro" section serves as a general guide, often featuring an image illustrating the topic, helping you recognize it and find the appropriate submenu for further assistance.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you have an enjoyable learning experience! If you'd like to contribute to this guide, feel free to send me a message in our group chats. I'm always open to discussing potential features and additions.</p>
